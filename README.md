### Core Focus: `useReducer Hook`

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
